Amazon Sales Assessment: Multi-Country Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive assessment of Amazon sales data across five countries, leveraging Databricks for advanced data analytics and visualization. The project demonstrates a professional workflow from raw data ingestion to actionable insights, using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

Project Overview
The assessment begins with the ingestion of the raw Amazon sales dataset (Amazon.csv), which includes detailed records of products, orders, customers, and regional information. Data cleaning and transformation are performed using PySpark in the Databricks notebook (amazon_sales.ipynb), ensuring high data quality and consistency. The notebook contains code for schema validation, data enrichment, and SQL analytics to extract key business insights such as sales trends, product performance, and customer segmentation.

Analytics and Visualizations
Advanced SQL queries in Sql-Queries.ipynb enable targeted analysis, answering specific business questions and supporting deeper exploration of sales dynamics. Interactive visualizations are created within the notebook to present findings in an accessible format, highlighting regional trends and performance metrics.

The project culminates in an interactive dashboard (configured in Finals.lvdash.json), allowing users to explore sales data dynamically, filter by region or product, and visualize trends over time. This dashboard enhances data storytelling and facilitates effective communication of insights to stakeholders.
